          1. Cats can bathe themselves
        </h2>
        <p className="font-hind font-light text-base sm:text-xl leading-[1.6] my-2">
          Cats are clean pretty much 100 percent of the time. That means you
          never have to take the time out of your day to perform the somewhat
          painstaking task of washing and grooming your cat.

          2. Cats will keep your house and yard rodent-free
        </h2>
        <p className="font-hind font-light text-base sm:text-xl leading-[1.6] my-2">
          If you are not a fan of rats, chipmunk, voles or mice in your home,
          owning a cat will take care of that right away. Your cat may even
          bring you its prize to make you proud!

          3. Cats are low-maintenance and independent
        </h2>
        <p className="font-hind font-light text-base sm:text-xl leading-[1.6] my-2">
          If you think you do not have the time or energy to own a pet, then a
          cat could be perfect for you. Taking care of a cat requires less
          responsibility than some other animals. Those who have full-time jobs
          can rest easy, knowing that their kitty can take care of itself for
          the most part. And when you do have extra time, cuddling up with your
          cat will feel better than ever.

          4. Cats are an eco-friendly pet choice
        </h2>
        <p className="font-hind font-light text-base sm:text-xl leading-[1.6] my-2">
          Living a “green” lifestyle can be difficult, but a cat is a great
          choice for potential pet owners looking to stay eco-friendly. Studies
          show that the lifetime resources needed to feed and care for a cat
          have a smaller carbon footprint than for other animals. Plus, most
          cats prefer fish to beef or corn, which is better for the environment.
          You can feel good about owning your kitty.

          5. Cats can help reduce stress
        </h2>
        <p className="font-hind font-light text-base sm:text-xl leading-[1.6] my-2">
          We all get stressed out, and people have many different ways of
          relieving their stress. Cat owners can reduce tensions by just
          stroking their furry friend&apos;s head. Petting a cat releases
          endorphins into the brain, which makes you happier. Also, cats have
          the softest fur!
