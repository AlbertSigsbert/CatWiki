<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![cat-wiki(screenshot)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66664314/216924870-95c1b143-ac42-41ba-8311-3cb9f8fd5d6d.png)

To create this project I used Nextjs due to many reasons but mainly because the project required a lot of server-side code so instead of using different frameworks for client and server code I opted for Nextjs which provides you with both.

For styling, I reached out to tailwind CSS due to its great compatibility with NextJS and also it's so natural and easy to use at least for me

Another feature that was a little bit tricky to implement was the most searched cat breeds because it's not directly supported by the given API so I had to get creative to implement it manually and I did achieve it using ContextAPI and LocalStorage

Finally, I have to admit it was so fun building this project especially since I am a cat lover it's always great to be able to use code to build the things you love :-)
